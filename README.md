# PHERRY
PHYTEC phyterns 2020 internship project. The PHERRY web scrapes WSDOT websites in order to grab the SEA-BI ferry schedule and location data, as well as, provide fun "Did you know?" ferry facts. The information from python3 codes is then displayed onto a GUI using Qt. 

#PHERRY_TRACKER
Contains all files needed to start the PHERRY program from boot, enable WiFi from boot and flashes a LED when ferry is at BI dock.
